~~Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)~~
~~Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.~~
~~Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.~~
Game seems to freeze sometimes. How to fix it?
