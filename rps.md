~~Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)~~
Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
Also need a button to "reset" the game.
Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.

```js
if (playerScore || computerScore <= 5) {
    start a new round;
}
```
